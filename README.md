Vanilla JS &amp; Web Audio API Step Sequencer / Drum Machine / Rhythm Composer

Drum Machine design by KK Lin - https://kklin.me/

**Overview:** \
Drumbell CR-07 is a Web based drum machine inspired by classic Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines for rhythm programming.
In order to build a step sequencer and better understand the theory behind Web Audio API I had two main sources of information:
  * A book by Turner W.  “JavaScript for Sound Artists. Learn to Code with the Web Audio API” - 2017. 
Specifically a step sequencer from section 23 which I had to translate from Jquery to Vanilla JS to have a better understanding behind the logic. 
It is also a backbone for my application.
  * Web audio documentation on MDN Web Docs
